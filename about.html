            <p>I was born on October 28 1999</p>
            <p>Fourth child to <a href="https://talishome.com/" target="_blank">Dr Tali Vishne</a> and <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94" target="_blank">Professor Uzi Vishne</a>, younger sibling to <a href="https://neurogal.github.io/" target="_blank">Gal</a>, <a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/ariel-vishne-b4027b216" target="_blank">Ariel</a> and <a href="https://www.hadardesigns.com/" target="_blank">Hadar</a>.</p>
            <p>As a young child we lived part time in the US, when my father worked at Yale and later at Princeton, where I learned to speak English.</p>
            <p>Growing up, we had many pets. Mostly cats.</p>
            <p>I studied at Moreshet Zvulun in elementary school and Tzfira in high school. Then I did national service for 2 years, 1 at The Family Affairs Aid Unit Under The Courts and 1 at The Veterinary Hospital in Beit Dagan. Right after that I started studying Chemistry and Biology in Bar Ilan university. after one year I transferred my studies to Computer Science and Biology. That didn't go so well so I transferred to John Bryce's Full Stack Web and Full Stack Python.</p>
            <p>While studying in university I also did a course on dog training and have a certificate for dog training. I also participated for a couple of years in Bar Ilan's begginer's choir, did some professional vocal training and recorded 4 songs professionally (covers of musical theatre songs).</p>
